We used Arvest for the digital publication of this conference. Here, you can browse an interactive conference programme, access links to all of the elements mentioned by the presenters as they say them, and watch presentations and access slides side by side.</p> <!> <p>Open the project in a new tab <a href="https://workspace.arvest.app/mirador/27ff704000d7fb984b5815cdb90f8eb2c06561e1/workspace.json" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p> <h2>Augmented theatre programmes</h2> <p>The ERC-funded <a href="https://stage-to-data.huma-num.fr/" rel="nofollow">STAGE project</a> takes a close and distant look at the programmes of the Festival d’Avignon, a contemporary theatre festival in Avignon, France. In this example project, we can browse digitized historical theatre programmes, and view some of the distant viewing network visualizations of the people involved with the festival across its history.</p> <!> <p>Open the project in a new tab <a href="https://workspace.arvest.app/mirador/67496070537a40e46d133c0f07805f658bd7436c/workspace.json" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p> <h2>Machine learning image discovery</h2> <p>In this example, we have used machine learning to proejct a collection of images into a 2-dimensional space, organized by similarity. Thanks to the annotations, this visualization becomes interactive, allowing the user to navigate straight to the image in question. Learn how to do this yourself by following <a href="https://arvest.app/en/learn/tutorials/ml-image-embedding" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a>.</p> <!> <p>Open the project in a new tab <a href="https://workspace.arvest.app/mirador/5d24337745e79799ac7b2d51b50327e69b3fb0df/workspace.json" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p> <h2>Dance analysis</h2> <p>Here is a basic example that mixes various different close and distant reading perspectives. Here we have taken a number of different snapshots in order to present the project in different states.</p> <p><strong><em>Presentation of the piece</em></strong>. Here we present the piece with a number of different types of elements, a multi-page programme, the music that accompanies the piece, and a video recording extract.</p> <!> <p>Open in a new tab <a href="https://workspace.arvest.app/mirador/de09a8e891d2ecc7d02da7e737fd93c9c018b2b7/workspace.json" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p> <p><strong><em>Programme comparison</em></strong>.
